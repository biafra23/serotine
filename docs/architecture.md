# Architecture

Serotine is laid out as a clean architecture with MVVM in the presentation
layer. This page is the contract every change is held to (the reviewer reads
it through CLAUDE.md); the Assets tab listing the managed accounts, an
account's own screens, and the recovery-phrase screen that adds one show each
rule in code.

## The modules and the dependency rule

**Dependencies point inward, and only inward.**

- `:domain` depends on nothing of ours and on no framework. Its libraries are
  coroutines' `Flow` and kotlincrypto's Keccak-256, which the transaction
  encoding hashes with (the EIP-1559 signing digest, the transaction hash),
  both pure Kotlin on every target. It has no Android target on purpose: Android
  consumers resolve its JVM variant, as they do kotlinx-coroutines, so nothing
  in it can ever import `android.*` (and that variant emits Java 17 class
  files, since Android dexes it).
- `:data` depends on `:domain`. It implements the ports (`AccountRepository`,
  `KeyStore`, `KnownUpgradeStore`, `TokenCatalog`, `UserTokens`,
  `DisplayCurrencySetting`, and `NativeBalances`, `TokenBalances`,
  `TokenMetadata`, `PriceFeeds`, `AddressKinds`, `LightClient`,
  `NetworkUpgrades`, and for sending `TransactionInputs`, `Broadcaster`,
  `ReceiptTracker` and `NameResolver`, over the embedded Myotis engine) and
  owns every data source.
- `:ui` depends on `:domain`. A ViewModel takes **use cases**, never a
  repository, and never sees `:data`.
- The hosts depend on `:ui` and `:data` and are the **only** places that know
  which adapter implements which port. Each has one composition root
  (`SerotineApplication` on Android, `main()` on desktop) that builds an
  `AppGraph` and hands it to `App`. A port whose adapter is the platform's own
  output rather than a data source — `UpgradeNotifier`, the notifications —
  is implemented in the host itself, since it needs the host's activity, icon
  or tray; the decision what to show stays a use case in `:domain`. The same
  goes for a seam an adapter needs from the host's window: the biometric prompt
  the key adapter's `BiometricPrompter` asks for is the Android host's
  `PlatformBiometricPrompter`, shown on the activity in front.

Anything that violates the arrows — a screen reaching for a repository, a use
case importing a Compose or Android type, `:data` depending on `:ui` — is a
review finding, whatever it saves.

## Packages

| package | contents |
|---|---|
| `eth.serotine.domain.model` | entities and value objects (`Account`, `Address`, `AccountKind`) — immutable, validated in `init`/factory |
| `eth.serotine.domain.repository` | the ports, as interfaces named after what they manage |
| `eth.serotine.domain.usecase` | one class per user-visible capability, `operator fun invoke` |
| `eth.serotine.data.<area>` | adapters, one package per area (`account`, `keys`, `engine`, `upgrade`, `tokens`, `prices`, `safe`, `settings`, `files`) |
| `eth.serotine.ui.<feature>` | one package per screen: `<Feature>Screen`, `<Feature>ViewModel`, `<Feature>UiState` |
| `eth.serotine.ui.components` | stateless composables more than one screen draws (the blockie, an account's avatar, a token's icon, a QR code, the long-press menu) and the display helpers they share (EIP-55, amounts, the light client's line, the seed screens' password step); no ViewModel, no use case |
| `eth.serotine.ui.platform` | the shared UI's `expect`/`actual` seams (keeping a window out of screen capture, keeping the display on, the clipboard, the share sheet, dates in the user's locale) |
| `eth.serotine.ui.theme` | Material 3 theme |
| `eth.serotine.android`, `eth.serotine.desktop` | the hosts |

## MVVM, the contract

- **A screen is a pure function of its UiState.** `AssetsScreen(state)` renders
  any `AssetsUiState` and holds no state of its own beyond transient UI details
  (scroll position, an expanded row). A UiState is a sealed interface or an
  immutable data class; its leaves are display-ready values (strings, enums),
  never a `Flow`, a repository or a platform type.
- **One `<Feature>Route` binds the screen to its ViewModel** —
  `collectAsStateWithLifecycle()`, plus the glue between the screen's lifecycle
  and its ViewModel: a state that ends the screen (an import that succeeded)
  becomes its navigation callback, and a screen that stops being shown becomes
  an intent (the seed screen drops its words); nothing else. It is the only
  composable that knows the ViewModel exists, which keeps every other screen
  renderable in a test with a hand-made state.
- **Every screen has previews.** `<Feature>ScreenPreviews.kt`, next to the
  screen, holds a `@Preview` (the multiplatform
  `org.jetbrains.compose.ui.tooling.preview.Preview`) per state the screen
  draws differently, plus one in the dark theme: the screen in
  `SerotineTheme`, fed a hand-made UiState with made-up data, as its UI
  tests are. Android Studio renders them on the Android target, and
  `<Feature>ScreenPreviewsTest` renders each one in the build.
- **Navigation is one `NavHost`, in `App`**, with a destination per screen. A
  screen's ViewModel is created by `viewModel {}` inside its destination, so
  the destination's back-stack entry owns it: it survives configuration
  changes while the screen is on the back stack and is cleared when the
  screen is popped. Routes say where the user wants to go through callbacks
  (`onAddAccount`, `onBack`); only `App` holds the `NavController`. The one
  exception is the update screen: its ViewModel decides whether the app shows
  anything else, so `App` creates it in the host's scope and navigates to the
  screen, clearing the back stack (both tabs' stacks included), while an
  update is required, and to the Assets tab's start once it no longer is.
- **Two tabs, Assets | Settings, under a bottom bar** — a `NavigationBar`, and
  a `NavigationRail` on a wide desktop window — around that one `NavHost`.
  Each tab is a nested graph. Settings opens over the Assets tab's stack and
  closes back down to it, so switching tabs keeps the user's place in Assets
  with no stack saved aside to go stale; re-selecting the current tab returns
  to its start. A route's arguments are identifiers only
  (`account/{address}`), never an object: the destination's ViewModel loads
  what it shows through its use cases. The bar shows on the tabs' screens; a
  flow that ends in a key operation or a transaction (import, create, send,
  a Safe transaction) is a destination of its own that covers it, and so is
  the update screen, outside both tabs. The screens themselves are
  docs/wallet-ux.md.
- **A ViewModel exposes `StateFlow<UiState>` and intent methods.** It derives
  state from use cases with `stateIn(viewModelScope, WhileSubscribed(5s), …)`,
  handles user intents by calling use cases, and holds no platform reference
  (no `Context`, no `Window`). It is the multiplatform
  `androidx.lifecycle.ViewModel`, created through `viewModel { graph.… }` so
  the host's `ViewModelStoreOwner` scopes it.
- **Use cases are the UI's only door into the domain.** A ViewModel's
  constructor lists what the screen can do; adding a capability adds a use
  case, not a repository call.
- **Errors are state.** A failure the user must see becomes a UiState variant
  (`Error(message)`), not an exception that escapes a coroutine.

## SOLID, as it applies here

- **Single responsibility** — a ViewModel per screen, a use case per
  capability, an adapter per data source. A class whose name needs "and" is
  two classes.
- **Open/closed** — behaviour varies through new implementations of a port or
  new UiState variants, not through flags threaded through existing code.
- **Liskov** — an adapter honours its port's contract in full, including the
  documented failure behaviour (`observeAccounts()` never fails; a port that
  can fail says so in its KDoc and its callers handle it).
- **Interface segregation** — ports are small and named for one concern.
  `AccountRepository` manages accounts; signing, balances and Safe
  transactions get ports of their own rather than one `WalletRepository`.
- **Dependency inversion** — `:domain` defines the ports; `:data` depends on
  them, never the other way round. No service locator, no static singletons:
  constructor injection from the composition root. (Manual wiring, no DI
  framework, until the graph is too large to read in one file — then a
  decision for the owner, not a drive-by dependency.)

## Kotlin conventions

- Immutable by default: `val`, `data class`, `List` not `MutableList` in any
  signature; `copy` for change.
- Value classes for domain identifiers (`Address`), validated at construction
  so an invalid one cannot exist.
- Structured concurrency only: `viewModelScope`, `runTest` in tests, never
  `GlobalScope`; `Flow` for streams, `suspend` for one-shot calls; no blocking
  on the main thread.
- `expect`/`actual` for the few platform seams, in the smallest source set
  that needs them; the common code never branches on the platform.
- KDoc on every public type: what it is, what it guarantees, what it never
  does. Comments say why; the code says what.
- Formatting: the official Kotlin style (`.editorconfig`), 120 columns,
  trailing commas on multi-line declarations and calls.

## Tests, per layer

| layer | kind | where |
|---|---|---|
| `:domain` | pure unit tests of value objects and use cases with fakes | `domain/src/commonTest` |
| `:data` | adapter tests against the port's contract | `data/src/commonTest` |
| `:ui` ViewModels | state-machine tests with `runTest` + a fake use case input, `Dispatchers.setMain` | `ui/src/commonTest` |
| `:ui` screens | headless Compose UI tests of the stateless screens (`createComposeRule`) | `ui/src/desktopTest` |
| hosts | the composition root wires and the app boots (an instrumented smoke test once there is an engine to boot) | per host |

`./gradlew build` runs all of them on the desktop JVM and as Android unit
tests. A test that needs a device or a network is `@Ignore`d by default and
documented.

## Adding a feature — the checklist

1. **Domain first.** The entity or value object, the port it needs (or an
   extension of one), the use case. Tests with a fake port.
2. **Adapter.** Implement the port in `:data`; test it against the port's
   contract.
3. **UiState + ViewModel.** The sealed state, the ViewModel mapping use-case
   output to it, the intents. Test the state transitions.
4. **Screen + Route.** The stateless screen, a UI test and a preview per state,
   the Route.
5. **Wire it.** `AppGraph` gets the ViewModel factory; the hosts supply the
   new adapter in their composition roots.
6. The PR describes the feature along these five lines, so a reviewer can
   check each layer against this page.
