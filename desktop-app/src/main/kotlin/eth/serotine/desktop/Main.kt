 * The desktop composition root: starts the process's one Myotis engine
 * (docs/embedding-myotis.md), builds the [AppGraph] from this platform's adapters and opens
 * the one window on the shared [App], and for as long as the app runs follows the engine's
 * network-upgrade reports into tray notices and lists the Safes this wallet deployed once the
 * light client proves them: the work no screen owns, run here beside the graph, on the same
 * adapters. The window provides the ViewModelStoreOwner the
 * navigation back stack keeps its screens' ViewModels in. Closing it ends the application
 * loop, and the engine is stopped after that, on the main thread: never on the Swing event
 * thread, which a slow network shutdown would freeze. One instance per user: a second one
 * finds the [InstanceLock] taken, says so and ends, so two never write the account list, the
 * keys or the engine's state at once.
