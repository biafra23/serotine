/**
 * This user's one running Serotine: an exclusive lock on a file in the app's data directory,
 * held until the process ends, when the OS releases it even after a crash. Two instances on
 * one data directory would both write the account list and the key store, and, with the
 * engine, open one database twice; the second one is refused instead.
 *
 * Nothing else in the process may open the lock file: on macOS and Linux the lock belongs to
 * the process, and closing ANY descriptor of the file drops it. That is why [acquire] refuses
 * a second acquisition within the process without opening the file again. A user who deletes
 * the file while Serotine runs defeats the guard: the next instance locks a new file.
