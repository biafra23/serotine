 * later one the system delivers at that time, the app running or not. iOS runs no app code at a
 * set time, so that one cannot carry the reminder's own words: it says a reminder about the
 * upgrade peers announced is due and asks the user to open the app, where the screens say the
 * rest and the notice due then replaces it. Shown with the app in front too, as on Android.
 * Without the user's permission ([askPermission]), nothing is shown: the app's own screens still
