/**
 * The iOS composition root: the process's one wallet, which the Swift app creates once, before
 * its first frame, and hands to [MainViewController]. It builds the [graph] from this platform's
 * adapters around the Myotis engine (docs/embedding-myotis.md), on the main thread as the desktop
 * does before its window: nothing here waits on the network, and only a simulator build may ask
 * the Secure Enclave anything ([iosHardwareSecret]). Beside the graph, on the same adapters, it
 * runs the work no screen owns: the engine's network-upgrade reports followed into
 * notifications, the Safes this wallet deployed listed once the light client proves them, and
 * how the transactions sent from here end recorded. That work runs while the app is in the
 * foreground; in the background the engine's networking is paused (a suspended app keeps no
 * sockets open) and resumed on return, and a reminder due meanwhile comes as the notification
 * [IosUpgradeNotifier] scheduled. The pause runs as a background task, so iOS lets it close the
 * engine's connections before it suspends the app. An app terminated while running shuts the
 * engine down, waiting for that only briefly ([TERMINATE_WAIT]); an app killed while suspended
 * runs no code, which the engine survives as any mobile app's state must.
