/**
 * Everything the Watch address screen renders (docs/wallet-ux.md, screen 10): what is typed
 * ([address]: an address or an ENS name; [name]), why it names no address ([addressError]),
 * what the field says otherwise ([addressNote]: a name being resolved, the block it was
 * resolved at), whether a name that could not be verified may be resolved again
 * ([canRetryLookup]), the name an empty [name] leaves the account with ([nameDefault]: the ENS
 * name typed, which the account's name then follows; null: "Account N"), what the light client
 * says is at the address ([detection], null until the text names one), and how adding went.
 *
 * With two or more networks on (docs/networks.md, N10 and N11), [detection] stays null and each
 * network says its own ([networks]); an address with no code on every one of them is offered on
 * all of them by [question] ("Watch it on Ethereum and Gnosis Chain?"), [choosing] once the user
 * asked to tick the networks instead. A Safe or another contract is offered only where it is.
 * [cardNetwork] is the network [detection] was read on, which Add adds it on. [noNetwork] says
 * that no network is on, so nothing can be checked. The networks that are off are
 * listed greyed out ([offNetworks]), each with Turn on as the way to check the address there too.
