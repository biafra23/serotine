/**
 * The Watch address screen's ViewModel: reads the typed text as an address (EIP-55 checked at
 * the input) or an ENS name, resolved as Send's recipient is ([ResolveRecipient], against
 * finalized state), shows what the light client proves is at the address, and adds it through
 * [WatchAddress], which checks again before it adds. A name is resolved again at Add: what is
 * watched is the address it has then, and one that moved is said, not added (issue #71). Added
 * by a name and given none of the user's, the account's name follows that ENS name (issue #67).
 *
 * The address is checked on every network that is on ([ObserveEnabledNetworks]), each held
 * running while the screen is open ([HoldNetwork]): with one, as one card; with more, a row each,
 * and an address with no code on all of them offered on all of them, or on those ticked
 * (docs/networks.md, N10 and N11). A name is resolved on every registry that is on, Ethereum's
 * and Sepolia's, each network's account at its own registry's address, and Gnosis Chain's at
 * Ethereum's, never a testnet's; each answer says which registry gave it (docs/networks.md, *Names*).
