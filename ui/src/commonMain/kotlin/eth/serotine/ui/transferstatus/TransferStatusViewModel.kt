/**
 * The transfer status screen's ViewModel (docs/wallet-ux.md, screen 9): the transfer [hash] on
 * [network], what this device recorded of it and where its verified receipt says it stands
 * ([ObserveSentTransfer]), as [TransferStatusUiState]. [formatTime] dates the broadcast a peer
 * took in the user's own time zone.
 *
 * Its one intent, [retry], is for a transaction recorded as maybe sent (its broadcast found no peer
 * to answer: `SentTransfer.maybeSent`) and not mined: it sends the same signed bytes again
 * ([RebroadcastTransfer]), never a new transaction, which could take the next nonce and pay twice.
 * Done is navigation.
 *
 * A Safe's deployment is listed in the wallet by `FollowSafeDeployments`, which the host runs
 * whatever screen is open (docs/wallet-ux.md, screen 15); this screen only shows where that
 * stands, from the deployment's record and the account list ([ObserveAccounts]).
