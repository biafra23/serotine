/**
 * The ViewModel of Create Safe (docs/wallet-ux.md, screens 13 to 15): first the network it is
 * created on (docs/networks.md, N12; by default the first that is on and has an account whose key is
 * held here to pay), then the Safe's
 * name and owners — the wallet's accounts, and addresses or ENS names typed ([ResolveRecipient]) —
 * then its threshold, held to the recovery shapes [PlanSafe] allows, then its deployment planned
 * (the address computed here) and quoted from an account whose key is held here
 * ([QuoteSafeDeployment]: the factory's verified run must return that address) for review, and
 * signed and broadcast ([DeploySafe]); one signed but not broadcast is retried with its own bytes
 * ([RebroadcastTransfer]), never signed anew.
 *
 * What is signed is the quote under review, and a quote is never signed stale: it is made when the
 * review is entered, again on Refresh, on a change of the payer or the fee, when the screen is
 * shown again after it was not, and when it is older than [QUOTE_MAX_AGE] at the tap that would
 * sign it ([timeSource] tells). The plan stays what it was while the review is open, so its
 * address does not move under the user; back to the threshold drops it, and the next review plans
 * anew (another salt, another address).
 *
 * One of the ViewModels the [WalletPassword] passes through (CLAUDE.md, *Trust*): it holds it in
 * the review's state while the field is shown, hands it to the signer in an [Unlock], and never
 * logs, saves or caches it; it is dropped once used, when the screen is not shown ([onHidden]) and
 * when the screen is gone ([onCleared]).
