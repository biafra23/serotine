// Create Safe in Android Studio's preview pane, one preview per state it draws differently, and each
// of its three steps in the dark theme. Built from display-ready values, as the screen tests are,
// never from the ViewModel. CreateSafeScreenPreviewsTest renders each one in createSafeScreenPreviews,
// at the end. The addresses are EIP-55's own examples; the names, the ENS name, amounts, blocks and
// the password are made up, and the Safe's address is the one cast computes for its owners in
// domain's SafeCreationTest. A preview has no window to keep out of screen capture, so the review's
// password field shows the line saying so, which a device that blocks capture does not.
