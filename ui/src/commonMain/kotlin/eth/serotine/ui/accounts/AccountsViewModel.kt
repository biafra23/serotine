/**

 * holds and what it is worth ([ObservePortfolio]), whether the ENS name an account's name
 * follows still points to it ([ObserveEnsNames]) — each network's light client and whether it
 * is on, and each network's upgrade this version does not support into [AccountsUiState]: a
 * section per network with accounts (docs/networks.md, N1, N2 and N18), a banner per network with
 * an upgrade, and a network blocked alone said in its own section, its accounts' Send greyed out
 * (*Upgrades and the update screen*). A network that cannot price the display currency says so
 * in its section and stays out of the total (*Values*). It holds no
 * platform reference and exposes state only through [uiState]; what the user does with an
 * account is navigation, which the screen's route turns into the destination of the screen or
 * dialog that does it, except turning a network on again ([turnOnNetwork]) and letting a light
 * client parked on a stale checkpoint catch up anyway ([syncPastStaleAnchor]; owner's request,
 * 2026-10-24), which its section warns of ([NetworkSection.staleAnchor]).
