 * those screens' routes, so each screen keeps its own UiState and ViewModel to what it does. A
 * screen draws the strip of the network it is about ([item]): an account's screen its account's
 * (docs/networks.md, *There is no current network*). It holds no platform reference and exposes
 * state only through [item].
