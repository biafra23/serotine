// The Send screen in Android Studio's preview pane, one preview per state it draws differently.
// Built from display-ready values, as the screen tests are, never from the ViewModel.
// SendScreenPreviewsTest renders each one in sendScreenPreviews, at the end. The addresses are
// EIP-55's own examples; the names, amounts, blocks and the password are made up. A preview has
// no window to keep out of screen capture, so the review's password field shows the line saying
// so, which a device that blocks capture does not.
