/**
 * The Send screen's ViewModel (docs/wallet-ux.md, screens 7 and 8): a transfer from [from] on
 * [network], composed — the asset ([asset] the token asked for, null for the network's currency),
 * the recipient typed or picked and resolved ([ResolveRecipient]), the amount in token units and
 * the fee level — then quoted from verified state ([QuoteTransfer]) for review, and signed and
 * broadcast ([SendTransfer]); one signed but not broadcast is retried with its own bytes
 * ([RebroadcastTransfer]), never signed anew.
 *
 * What is signed is the quote under review, and a quote is never signed stale: it is made when
 * the review is entered, again on Refresh, when the screen is shown again after it was not, and
 * when it is older than [QUOTE_MAX_AGE] at the tap that would sign it ([timeSource] tells), and
 * it is dropped by any change of what it was made for. The biometric prompt gets what is left of
 * that age as its deadline ([promptDeadline]): one answered later signs nothing, and the quote is
 * made again. Its recipient's name is resolved again
 * with every quote. A price never reaches it: the amount is what was typed, in token units.
 *
 * One of the ViewModels the [WalletPassword] passes through (CLAUDE.md, *Trust*): it holds it in
 * the review's state while the field is shown, hands it to the signer in an [Unlock], and never
 * logs, saves or caches it; it is dropped once used, when the screen is not shown ([onHidden])
 * and when the screen is gone ([onCleared]).
