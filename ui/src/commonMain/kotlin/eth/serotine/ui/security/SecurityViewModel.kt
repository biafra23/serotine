 * password, which opens each stored key once so the biometric key can wrap it, then one
 * fingerprint or face check that proves it) and off (no password: it deletes a way in). One of
 * the ViewModels the [WalletPassword] passes through: it keeps it in its state only while its
 * field is shown, takes it out of the state at the tap that uses it (the call holds it from then
