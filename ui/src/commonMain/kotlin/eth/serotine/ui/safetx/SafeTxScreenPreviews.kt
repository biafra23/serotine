// The Safe transaction screen in Android Studio's preview pane, one preview per state it draws
// differently. Built from display-ready values, as the screen tests are, never from the
// ViewModel. SafeTxScreenPreviewsTest renders each one in safeTxScreenPreviews, at the end. The
// addresses are EIP-55's own examples; the hash, request text, amounts, blocks and the password
// are made up. A preview has no window to keep out of screen capture, so a step's password field
// shows the line saying so, which a device that blocks capture does not.
