/**
 * The ViewModel of a Safe's settings (docs/wallet-ux.md, screen 28): the Safe at [account] as its
 * verified storage holds it ([ObserveSafe]), and the changes of its settings an owner held here can
 * propose — an owner added, replaced or removed, the threshold changed, a module disabled, the
 * guard removed — each filled in its form, checked as it is typed against the Safe as verified
 * ([problem]), then proposed from verified state ([ProposeSafeSettingsChange]: at the Safe's next
 * nonce, its call run as a verified call from the Safe where the engine will) for review, and
 * signed by an owner held here ([SignSafeTx]), which queues it.
 *
 * What is signed is the proposal under review, and a proposal is never signed stale: it is made
 * when the review is entered, again on Refresh, when the screen is shown again after it was not,
 * and when it is older than [QUOTE_MAX_AGE] at the tap that would sign it ([timeSource] tells).
 * Nothing is queued until it is signed, so a proposal given up takes no nonce.
 *
 * One of the ViewModels the [WalletPassword] passes through (CLAUDE.md, *Trust*): it holds it in
 * the review's state while the field is shown, hands it to the signer in an [Unlock], and never
 * logs, saves or caches it; it is dropped once used, when the screen is not shown ([onHidden]) and
 * when the screen is gone.
