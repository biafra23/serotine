 * was verified; null without a rate) in the direction [trend] says, and the [note] that dates it
 * and says where it comes from ("Verified 14:05 · may have changed since · testnet prices"). The host draws it in its own
 * widget toolkit, green for [Trend.UP] and red for [Trend.DOWN]. [icon] is the watched asset's
 * bundled icon key ([eth.serotine.ui.components.TokenIcons]'s keys; null: no icon shown), drawn
 * in the widget's top-left corner.

 * the pair as far as it is chosen ("LINK · EUR"; "ETH" where it follows the display currency).
 * The note names the widget's network first, each widget showing one (docs/networks.md, *The
 * widget*). Being a rate kept and shown later, it says it may have changed since it was verified,
 * or, while the network is not [on] in this wallet, that it is off (nothing reads it then); one
 * whose feeds were stale says how old its price is. On a testnet every rate says "testnet
 * prices" (CLAUDE.md, *Data sources*). [icon] is the bundled icon key of [pair]'s base
 * ([eth.serotine.domain.usecase.RateWidgetChoices.icon]; the host resolves it, since this
 * function stays a pure, display-ready mapping), passed straight through.
