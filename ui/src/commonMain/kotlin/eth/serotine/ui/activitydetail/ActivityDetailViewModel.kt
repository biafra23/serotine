 * (docs/wallet-ux.md, screen 26), the row [key] names: a transaction this device sent, read from
 * the account's history ([ObserveAccountHistory]); or a token's transfer or a Safe's event, read
 * from the engine's verified log index as the Activity reads them ([ObserveTokenTransfers],
 * [ObserveSafeHistory]). Its headline and status are its row's ([ActivityRows]); its fields name
 * every address and hash it concerns in full, with the wallet's names for them ([ObserveAccounts])
 * and the tokens' symbols and decimals ([ObserveKnownTokens]). One received from an address the
 * wallet never sent to ([ObserveSentToAddresses]) and that is none of its accounts says why to
 * compare it before copying it. A transfer of a contract the wallet
 * does not list is a claim, as its row is: only the contract is named, and an ERC-20 one can be
 * added. No intents: Copy is the screen's own, Status and Add token are navigation.
