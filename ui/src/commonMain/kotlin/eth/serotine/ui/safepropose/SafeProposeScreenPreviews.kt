// Send for a Safe in Android Studio's preview pane, one preview per state it draws differently.
// Built from display-ready values, as the screen tests are, never from the ViewModel.
// SafeProposeScreenPreviewsTest renders each one in safeProposeScreenPreviews, at the end. The
// addresses are EIP-55's own examples; the names, amounts, blocks and the password are made up. A
// preview has no window to keep out of screen capture, so the review's password field shows the
// line saying so, which a device that blocks capture does not.
