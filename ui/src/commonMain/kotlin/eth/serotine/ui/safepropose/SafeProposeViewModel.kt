/**
 * The ViewModel of Send for a Safe (docs/wallet-ux.md, screens 7 and 16): a transfer from the Safe
 * at [safe] on [network], composed in Send's form — the asset ([asset] the token asked for, null
 * for the network's currency), the recipient typed or picked and resolved ([ResolveRecipient]),
 * the amount in token units; no fee, which the account that executes it pays — then proposed from
 * verified state ([ProposeSafeTx]: at the Safe's next nonce, the Safe's balance less what those
 * queued before it move, its call run as a verified call from the Safe where the engine will) for
 * review, and signed by an owner held here ([SignSafeTx]), which queues it.
 *
 * What is signed is the proposal under review, and a proposal is never signed stale: it is made
 * when the review is entered, again on Refresh, when the screen is shown again after it was not,
 * and when it is older than [QUOTE_MAX_AGE] at the tap that would sign it ([timeSource] tells); its
 * recipient's name is resolved again with every one. Nothing is queued until it is signed, so a
 * proposal given up takes no nonce. A price never reaches it.
 *
 * One of the ViewModels the [WalletPassword] passes through (CLAUDE.md, *Trust*): it holds it in the
 * review's state while the field is shown, hands it to the signer in an [Unlock], and never logs,
 * saves or caches it; it is dropped once used, when the screen is not shown ([onHidden]) and when
 * the screen is gone.
