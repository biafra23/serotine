// Swap for a Safe in Android Studio's preview pane, one preview per state it draws differently.
// Built from display-ready values, as the screen tests are, never from the ViewModel.
// SafeSwapScreenPreviewsTest renders each one in safeSwapScreenPreviews, at the end. The addresses
// are EIP-55's own examples and Sepolia's pinned router; the names, amounts, blocks, times and the
// password are made up. A preview has no window to keep out of screen capture, so the review's
// password field shows the line saying so, which a device that blocks capture does not.
