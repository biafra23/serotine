// A Safe's swap in simple mode in Android Studio's preview pane, one preview per state it draws
// differently from Detailed view. Built from display-ready values, never from the ViewModel.
// SimpleSafeSwapScreenPreviewsTest renders each one in simpleSafeSwapScreenPreviews, at the end. The
// addresses are EIP-55's own examples and Sepolia's pinned router; the amounts, blocks and times are
// made up.
