/**
 * The Uniswap v3 deployments swaps go through, per network (docs/swaps.md, *Pins*).
 *
 * Sepolia's addresses are the deployment table of Uniswap's developer docs
 * (docs.uniswap.org, *Ethereum Deployments*, Sepolia), read 2026-10-18. The code hashes were read
 * on 2026-10-19 at block 11,947,882 with Foundry's `cast codehash` against a public Sepolia RPC
 * node, a debugging source only (CLAUDE.md, *Data sources*): what it says is what is expected, and
 * the app proves each hash through the light client before quoting anything, so a wrong pin makes
 * Uniswap unavailable, never a wrong swap. Each code was checked to be what it is pinned as: it
 * dispatches the selectors the domain calls (the factory `getPool`, `createPool` and `owner`;
 * QuoterV2 both quotes; SwapRouter02 `multicall`, `exactInputSingle`, `exactInput` and
 * `unwrapWETH9`; WETH9 `deposit` and `withdraw`), and QuoterV2's hash was the same from a second
 * node. None of the four is a proxy, so none can change its code.
 *
 * On Sepolia USDC, LINK and UNI have a pool with WETH at each of the four tiers, the 0.01 % tier
 * included (`feeAmountTickSpacing(100)` is 1), and USDC/LINK, USDC/UNI and LINK/UNI pools of their
 * own, and a quote touches 9 to 16 storage slots of 3 to 6 contracts (`eth_createAccessList` of
 * QuoterV2's calls), each a proof the engine fetches, read the same day. Every built-in token
 * added since has at least one WETH pool with liquidity (docs/swaps.md, *The cost*).
 *
 * Ethereum's are the canonical deployment of the same table (*Ethereum Deployments*, Mainnet):
 * the v3 factory, QuoterV2, SwapRouter02 and WETH9. Their code hashes were read on 2026-10-23
 * at mainnet block 26,256,227 (`eth_getProof`'s code hash; WETH9's as the hash of its code)
 * through two public nodes, which agreed, a debugging source only, as above: what is expected,
 * which the light client proves before any quote (`MyotisHostEthereumTest` does so on the real
 * chain). None of the four is a proxy.
