/**
 * The CoW Protocol deployments orders are signed for, per network (docs/swaps.md, *An order, step

 *
 * The addresses are CoW's, the same on every network it runs on (docs.cow.fi, *Core contracts*,
 * and cowprotocol/contracts' `networks.json`), read 2026-10-22. The code hashes were read on
 * 2026-10-22 at block 11,969,176 with Foundry's `cast codehash` against two public Sepolia RPC
 * nodes, which agreed, a debugging source only (CLAUDE.md, *Data sources*): what it says is what
 * is expected, and the app proves each hash through the light client before quoting anything, so a
 * wrong pin makes CoW unavailable, never a wrong order. Checked the same day: the settlement's
 * code dispatches every selector the domain calls (`domainSeparator`, `filledAmount`,
 * `invalidateOrder`) and `settle`; its `domainSeparator()` is the one the domain computes for
 * Sepolia; its `vaultRelayer()` is the relayer pinned here. Neither contract is a proxy, so
 * neither can change its code; the settlement's immutables (its authenticator, vault, relayer
 * and domain separator) are in that code, so its hash pins them too.
