/**
 * One value kept in the file at [path] as a versioned JSON document: what the account list and
 * the token settings share. [decode] reads a document of a version up to [formatVersion] (and
 * throws on anything it would not accept: the file is then damaged); [encode] writes the
 * current one, `version` first.
 *
 * Writing: the whole document, into a temporary file of its own whose data is flushed to the
 * disk ([writeSynced]), then moved over the file in one step, and the directory flushed after
 * the move ([syncDirectoryOf]). A crash or a power loss during a write leaves the previous
 * document or the new one, each complete; where a directory cannot be flushed (Windows) a power
 * loss just after the move may still leave the previous one. Each change reads the file again
 * first. One process writes the file: Android runs one, and the desktop host holds a per-user
 * instance lock; were a second one to write it, it could lose a change only within that one
 * change.
 *
 * Reading, which never destroys or hides what is stored:
 * - no file: [empty];
 * - a newer format, or a file that cannot be read: [Read.Unreadable], the file untouched, and
 *   nothing can be changed until it can be read. An unreadable file is read again by every
 *   new subscriber, and every [RETRY_INTERVAL] while one stays subscribed, so it recovers on
 *   its own once the file can be read (a lock released, a permission fixed);
 * - a damaged file: set aside under a name of its own (`<file>.damaged-<random>`, never
 *   replacing an earlier one), then [empty], saying so ([Read.Loaded.damagedSetAside]); if it
 *   cannot be set aside, Unreadable;
 * - a file [incomplete] says [decode] passed parts of over (entries it could not decode):
 *   copied aside under the same kind of name, once, and what was read written in its place, so
 *   that nothing passed over is lost at the next write; saying so too. The file is never left
 *   missing: if either step cannot be done it stays as it is, and what was read is used.
 *
 * File work runs on [dispatcher], never the caller's thread. Problems are reported on standard
 * output by type only, naming the file as [what]: an exception message could quote the
 * file's contents. [writeFile] is [writeSynced] but in tests.
