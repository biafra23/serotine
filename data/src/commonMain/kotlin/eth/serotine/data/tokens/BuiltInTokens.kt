/**
 * The built-in token list (CLAUDE.md, *Data sources*: built in, each entry checked against
 * its contract when listed), per network, each with a bundled icon (`TokenIcons`). On Sepolia
 * (the owner's choices, 2026-10-17 and 2026-10-22):
 * - the issuers' own test deployments: Circle's USDC and EURC, Paxos's PYUSD, Chainlink's
 *   LINK and Uniswap's UNI, with WETH9, the wrapped ether Uniswap's list names and the swaps
 *   pin (`UniswapDeployments`);
 * - the tokens of Aave v3's Sepolia market (bgd-labs/aave-address-book, `AaveV3Sepolia`):
 *   Aave's own GHO, and the faucet tokens DAI, USDT, WBTC and AAVE, which anyone can mint and
 *   which are not their issuers', so none has a price.
 *
 * Uniswap's default list names only UNI and WETH on Sepolia; its pools there hold
 * look-alikes of most other symbols, so a token's pools do not make it the real one.
 *
 * USDC, LINK and UNI were checked on 2026-10-17 at Sepolia block 11,932,144, the rest on
 * 2026-10-22 at block 11,966,329 (USDC, LINK and UNI again with them), with verified calls
 * through the Myotis engine (`symbol()`, `decimals()`, `name()`, each as listed here).
 *
 * On Ethereum, the plan's candidates (docs/networks.md, *Values*; the owner's ruling of
 * 2026-10-22 takes them): the issuers' own contracts of USDC, USDT, DAI, WBTC, LINK, UNI, EURC,
 * PYUSD, GHO and AAVE, and WETH9, each priced by its own Chainlink feed (WETH by ether's, WBTC
 * by WBTC / BTC). Read on 2026-10-23 at mainnet block 26,256,215 through two public nodes,
 * which agreed, a debugging source only (CLAUDE.md, *Data sources*): `symbol()`, `name()` and
 * `decimals()`, each as listed here. The app checks every entry against its contract through
 * the light client at every run, and `MyotisHostEthereumTest` does so on the real chain.
 *
 * On Gnosis Chain, the plan's candidates (the same ruling): WXDAI, both USDCs (the Omnibridge's
 * `USDC` and the Circle-standard bridged `USDC.e`, two tokens, each under the symbol its contract
 * gives), USDT, WETH, GNO, Monerium's EURe and sDAI. EURe is its current contract: Monerium's
 * first one, `0xcB444e90…`, still answers `EURe` too, and is not listed. The bridged tokens are
 * priced by their originals' feeds (USDC, USDT, ether), as WETH is by ether's, and WXDAI by xDAI's;
 * EURe, an e-money euro, by EUR / USD; sDAI, a vault share worth more than one xDAI, has no feed and
 * no price. Read on 2026-10-23 at Gnosis block 48,904,226 through two public Gnosis nodes, which
 * agreed, a debugging source only: `symbol()`, `name()` and `decimals()`, each as listed here; the
 * app checks every entry through the light client at every run, and `MyotisHostGnosisTest` does so
 * on the real chain.
 *
 * Added 2026-10-28, on the owner's instruction (docs/networks.md, *Values*), to list GNO, COW
 * and SAFE on every network they exist on: Gnosis's own GNO
 * (already listed on Gnosis Chain) is added on Ethereum too; CoW Protocol's COW and Safe's SAFE
 * are each added on Ethereum, the issuer's own contract, and on Gnosis Chain, the official
 * bridge's deployment of the Ethereum token (`docs.cow.fi`'s own token table for COW; for SAFE,
 * not in the Safe Foundation's own token page, which names Ethereum only, but its contract
 * answers `name()` as "Safe Token from Mainnet", the Omnibridge's own naming for a bridged
 * token, the same as GNO's "Gnosis Token on xDai" and COW's "CoW Protocol Token from Mainnet").
 * None of the three has a Chainlink feed on Ethereum or on Gnosis Chain beyond the GNO / USD one
 * already pinned on Gnosis Chain (checked against `reference-data-directory.vercel.app`'s
 * `feeds-mainnet.json` and `feeds-xdai-mainnet.json`), so GNO has no price on Ethereum and COW
 * and SAFE have none on either network. None of the three has a Sepolia deployment, so none is
 * added there. Read on 2026-10-28 at mainnet blocks 26,289,553 to 26,289,569 and at Gnosis
 * blocks 48,982,469 to 48,982,471, each through two public nodes, which agreed, a debugging
 * source only: `symbol()`, `name()` and `decimals()`, each as listed here.
