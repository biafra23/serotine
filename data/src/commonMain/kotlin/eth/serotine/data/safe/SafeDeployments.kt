 */

/**
 * The Safe deployments a Safe is recognised by, per network (docs/wallet-ux.md, *Safes*): the
 * runtime code hashes of the canonical SafeProxy contracts ([Table.proxyCodeHashes], lower-case
 * hex without `0x`), and the canonical singletons a proxy's slot 0 must name
 * ([Table.singletons]). A contract matching neither is "another contract", never a Safe.
 *
 * Read on Sepolia on 2026-10-17 with verified reads through the Myotis engine, at blocks
 * 11,933,239 to 11,933,240: each singleton's code, and its `VERSION()` as a verified call;
 * each proxy hash as the code a verified create call of the factory's `proxyCreationCode()`
 * returns (1.3.0's also from its `proxyRuntimeCode()`, the same). The eip155 deployments of
 * 1.3.0 have the same code as the canonical ones.
 *
 * A new Safe is created from [Table.creation] (docs/wallet-ux.md, *Safes*: creation): Safe 1.4.1,
 * its L1 singleton (Safe{Wallet}'s choice for Ethereum and its testnets) and its SafeProxyFactory,
 * with no fallback handler: `setup` installs none. (The one CompatibilityFallbackHandler a Safe
 * transaction may set is pinned in the domain, `PinnedFallbackHandlers`, beside the check that
 * refuses any other.) The factory's proxy creation code is `SafeProxy`'s `bytecode` in the npm package
 * `@safe-global/safe-contracts` 1.4.1-build.0
 * (`build/artifacts/contracts/proxies/SafeProxy.sol/SafeProxy.json`), the build the canonical
 * deployment came from: the runtime code it deploys hashes to the 1.4.1 proxy hash below, read on
 * Sepolia, and that package's SafeProxyFactory runtime code hashes to the factory's code hash in
 * safe-global/safe-deployments (`src/assets/v1.4.1/safe_proxy_factory.json`, `0x50c3cdc4…`). It
 * is only what is expected: a deployment is quoted only when the factory's verified run returns
 * the address computed from it.
 *
 * Ethereum has the same canonical deployments at the same addresses, so the same table. Read on
 * mainnet on 2026-10-23 at blocks 26,256,229 to 26,256,247 through two public nodes, which
 * agreed, a debugging source only (CLAUDE.md, *Data sources*): each singleton's `VERSION()` as
 * listed; each factory's proxy creation code, deployed by an `eth_call`, runs to the code whose
 * hash is pinned below (1.3.0's factory and its eip155 twin alike), and 1.4.1's factory returns
 * exactly [PROXY_CREATION_CODE_1_4_1] and has the code hash `0x50c3cdc4…` named above. The light
 * client proves a Safe's proxy and singleton before it is one, and `MyotisHostEthereumTest` does
 * so on the real chain.
 *
 * Gnosis Chain has them too, read the same way on 2026-10-23 at Gnosis blocks 48,904,729 to
 * 48,904,737 through two public Gnosis nodes, which agreed: the same `VERSION()`s and proxy
 * runtime hashes, and 1.4.1's factory's code hash `0x50c3cdc4…` with 486 bytes of creation code.
 * Only its [Table.creation] differs: Safe{Wallet} creates SafeL2 there, the 1.4.1 L2 singleton
 * (owner ruling, 2026-10-22; docs/networks.md, open question 6), whose events let any indexer
 * follow the Safe; `MyotisHostGnosisTest` proves the deployments through the light client.
 *
 * A Safe older than 1.3.0 is recognised too (issue: diskordia.eth, an address the user reported
 * as "a recognised Safe" that Serotine showed as a plain contract): 1.0.0, 1.1.1 and 1.2.0, the
 * three Mainnet releases of `safe-global/safe-deployments` before 1.3.0 introduced the `Safe`
 * rename and the guard. Their `GnosisSafe.sol` is `MasterCopy, ModuleManager, OwnerManager, ...`
 * (1.0.0's `BaseSafe` is `ModuleManager, OwnerManager` under another name): the same six slots
 * `readSafe` already reads, with no guard (read as none, since nothing was ever written at its
 * hashed slot) and, before 1.3.0 added `moduleGuard`, none of that either. A Safe left on one of
 * these singletons is still read as what it is; one moved since to a pinned singleton by the
 * owners' own `changeMasterCopy` call (as diskordia.eth was, to the 1.3.0 L1 singleton already
 * pinned above) needs only its [Table.proxyCodeHashes] widened, since its proxy's own code never
 * changes. 1.2.0 reused 1.1.1's `ProxyFactory` (`safe-deployments` lists no `v1.2.0` factory of
 * its own), so one more proxy hash plus three more singletons cover all three:
 * - 1.0.0's `ProxyFactory` 0x12302fE9c02ff50939BaAaaf415fc226C078613C and its singleton
 *   0xb6029EA3B2c51D09a50B53CA8012FeEB05bDa35A ("Gnosis Safe" `VERSION()` "1.0.0");
 * - 1.1.1's `ProxyFactory` 0x76E2cFc1F5Fa8F6a5b3fC4c8F4788F0116861F9B (also 1.2.0's) and its
 *   singleton 0x34CfAC646f301356fAa8B21e94227e3583Fe3F5F ("1.1.1");
 * - 1.2.0's singleton 0x6851D6fDFAfD08c0295C392436245E5bc78B0185 ("1.2.0").
 *
 * Each factory's `proxyRuntimeCode()` (`addacc0f`, unchanged since 1.0.0) and each singleton's
 * `VERSION()` were read as an `eth_call` on Mainnet at block 26,289,609 through two independent
 * public nodes, which agreed (publicnode.com and drpc.org; a debugging source only, CLAUDE.md,
 * *Data sources*: the Myotis engine is what proves them for a user). The same two addresses carry
 * the same code and `VERSION()`s on Gnosis Chain at block 48,982,569, `networkAddresses` in
 * `safe-deployments` lists Gnosis among them, and 1.1.1's `ProxyFactory` runtime code there was
 * read in full and starts with the same selector table (`addacc0f` among them). Diskordia.eth's
 * own deployed code, read directly, is exactly 1.1.1's `proxyRuntimeCode()` byte for byte.
