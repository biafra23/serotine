 * A Uniswap v3 pool pinned to price [priceId] where no Chainlink feed is pinned for it (CLAUDE.md,

 * the network's WETH at [fee] (in hundredths of a basis point, as the factory names a tier), at
 * [pool], quoted in [quote]. The pin says which pool is expected; the network's pinned factory
 * proves it (`getPool` must return [pool]). [minQuoteDepth] is the floor of the pool's depth:
 * its in-range liquidity as the WETH it stands for at the price now, in whole WETH. A shallower

/**

 * Chosen 2026-10-29 at mainnet block 26,298,245, read through two public nodes, which agreed (a
 * debugging source only, CLAUDE.md, *Data sources*), among the pinned factory's pools of each
 * token with WETH and USDC, every fee tier:
 * - COW: the 1 % tier (≈ 2.0 M COW and 26 WETH held, in range ≈ 77.5 WETH deep; 76 observations
 *   reaching back ≈ 202 h). The 0.3 % tier is deeper, ≈ 209 WETH, but keeps one observation, so its
 *   "average" is its spot price.
 * - SAFE: the 0.3 % tier (≈ 1.06 M SAFE and 49 WETH held, ≈ 292 WETH deep; 51 observations
 *   reaching back ≈ 2.8 h, so a day back is "24h —"). The 1 % tier is 0.3 WETH deep.
 * The USDC pools of both hold dust. The floor, 25 WETH deep, keeps both and refuses a pool
 * drained to a third of the shallower one's depth today.
