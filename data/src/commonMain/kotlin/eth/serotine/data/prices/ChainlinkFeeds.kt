 * The feed table per network (CLAUDE.md, *Data sources*: Chainlink aggregators read through

 * prices they give are not market values.
 *
 * Sepolia's proxies, decimals and heartbeats from Chainlink's feed directory
 * (`reference-data-directory.vercel.app/feeds-ethereum-testnet-sepolia.json`), read on
 * 2026-10-17. Each feed was read the same day with verified calls through the Myotis engine at
 * Sepolia blocks 11,932,880 to 11,932,883: `description()` named the pair and `decimals()`
 * answered as pinned.
 *
 * Ethereum's from the same directory (`feeds-mainnet.json`), read on 2026-10-23: one feed per
 * built-in token and display currency that has one there, each X / USD but WBTC's, which is
 * WBTC / BTC and goes through BTC / USD. Each was read the same day at mainnet blocks 26,256,203
 * to 26,256,210 through two public nodes, which agreed, a debugging source only (CLAUDE.md,
 * *Data sources*): `description()` named the pair and `decimals()` answered 8. The light client
 * proves every answer it serves, and `MyotisHostEthereumTest` reads each feed through it.
 *
 * Gnosis Chain's from the same directory (`feeds-xdai-mainnet.json`), read on 2026-10-23, each
 * X / USD with a day's heartbeat. It has no xDAI / USD feed, so xDAI (and WXDAI) take DAI / USD's
 * answer, the ruling's fallback (owner ruling, 2026-10-22; docs/networks.md, open question 3):
 * xDAI is DAI bridged to Gnosis, redeemable one for one. It has no GBP feed. Each was read the
 * same day at Gnosis block 48,904,243 through two public Gnosis nodes, which agreed, a debugging
 * source only: `description()` named the pair and `decimals()` answered 8. The light client
 * proves every answer it serves, and `MyotisHostGnosisTest` reads each feed through it.
