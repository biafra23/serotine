/**
 * [UniswapV3Chain] over the engine's verified reads, on [network], the one network its engine
 * follows: [pinned] (that network's pinned deployment, `UniswapDeployments` by default) is a
 * venue once the code of each of its contracts, proven against the light client's state
 * ([VerifiedChain.proveCode], the four in parallel), hashes to its pin. A check that passed, or
 * proved code other than a pin's ([VenueReading.CodeMismatch]), is remembered for as long as this
 * adapter lives: deployed code does not change, and a pin that is wrong stays wrong until the
 * build that carries it is replaced. One check runs at a time: callers that come while one runs
 * wait for it, and share its answer when it settled; after one that could not be proven, each
 * runs its own, since a proof missing a moment ago may be had now. Any other network has no venue
 * here ([VenueReading.NotPinned]): this engine reads no other chain.
 *
 * A call is a verified call at the head ([VerifiedChain.call]), labelled with the block the
 * engine names. Asked only while the light client can verify reads at its head
 * ([whyUnreadable]), on [dispatcher]; an engine that fails, or a CancellationException its own
 * code throws, is no answer, as for every verified read. A device without an engine ([chain]
 * null) answers [ReadUnavailable.NO_ENGINE].
