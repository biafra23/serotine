/**
 * [PriceFeeds] over a verified light client: each [PinnedFeed]'s `decimals()` and
 * `latestRoundData()` as verified calls ([VerifiedChain.call]), through [ProvenReads], at
 * every verified head that [activity] cannot vouch for. A proof records the aggregator the
 * proxy pointed to (`aggregator()`, called with it), and stands, re-dated at each later head,
 * while no block since it was proven may have changed the answer: no log of that aggregator —
 * every new round emits one — and no change to the proxy's own state, which a switch to
 * another aggregator is (block access lists: until a chain has them, every price is proven
 * at every head, as without [activity], and `aggregator()` is not called). A proof stands only
 * when its `decimals()`, its round and its aggregator were all read at the same block — the
 * same proven hash, not only the same number — and only
 * for a price ([FeedReading.Verified]); every proof reads `decimals()`, since the proxy's
 * aggregator can be replaced; one that differs from the pin, a non-positive answer, or what
 * is no round, is no price. A round is stale once it is older than the feed's heartbeat and [STALE_GRACE_SECONDS]
 * (a heartbeat update lands a little after the heartbeat, not at it), measured against the
 * time of the verified head the read was made at, never the device's clock; a head whose time
 * is not known yet gives no reading (unproven) rather than a guess. A round dated more than
 * [FUTURE_SKEW_SECONDS] after that head is what no feed answers.
