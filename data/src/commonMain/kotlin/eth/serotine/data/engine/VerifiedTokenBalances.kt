/**
 * [TokenBalances] over a verified light client: the token contract's `balanceOf(holder)` run
 * as a verified call ([VerifiedChain.call]), polled, cached and refused as [ProvenReads]
 * describes, and — for the tokens in [gated] alone — called again only at a head that
 * [activity] cannot vouch for: one whose blocks since the call it did not all check for a log
 * naming the holder, as a transfer's does. That holds only for a plain ERC-20, whose balances
 * move by a logged `Transfer` naming both sides, so only the network's built-in tokens are
 * gated. A token a user adds by address is called at every head, as without [activity]: it may
 * move balances with no log naming the holder (a rebasing token, an interest-bearing aToken, a
 * streaming or vesting token, a reflection token, a `Transfer` with unindexed parties). Even a
 * built-in token behind an upgradeable proxy could change through an upgrade; that one is
 * accepted, and a kept balance is still re-proven at the holder's next transfer. A call that reverts, or returns anything but one word, is a verified "not a
 * token" ([TokenBalanceReading.NotAToken]); one the engine refuses for good is
 * [ReadUnavailable.REFUSED]; one it cannot answer right now is unproven. While no head can be
 * read, the last proof, made in this process or kept in [LastBalancesFile] from an earlier one,
 * is [TokenBalanceReading.LastKnown].
