/**
 * The balances the light client last verified, kept in the file at [path] (a
 * [VersionedJsonFile]) so that after a restart a row shows them as last known until a head can
 * be read again (owner's request, 2026-10-19). Each entry is public chain data: an amount, the
 * block it was proven at and the time of the head it was proven at, under an address (or a holder
 * and a token); no key material. Shown only, never acted on: a quote and a signature read a fresh
 * proof (docs/wallet-ux.md).
 *
 * At most [maxKept] entries ([MAX_KEPT] but in tests), the least recently proven dropped first.
 * A balance is written again only when it changed or its stored proof is [REWRITE_AFTER_BLOCKS]
 * blocks old, not at every head, so the time a row shows may be up to that much older than the
 * last proof: an earlier time at which the same amount was verified. A file that cannot be read
 * keeps and shows nothing; a damaged one is set aside as every [VersionedJsonFile] is. File work
 * runs on [dispatcher], and every write is flushed to the disk (twice: the file, then its
 * directory).
 *
 * Each entry's id starts with its network's chain id (`11155111:native:0x…`): a balance is an
 * address's on one network. Format 1 wrote ids without one, when Serotine worked on Sepolia
 * alone, so they read as Sepolia's (docs/networks.md, *Files*).
