 * writes its tracing lines into a ring of its own (4096 lines, the oldest dropped when full),
 * which a host has to drain, so without this a running engine's account of its sync (peers
 * found and dropped, heads followed, proofs refused) is never seen. [drain] takes up to its
 * argument's lines out of that ring, oldest first and newline-joined, empty when none wait;
 * each line goes to [sink] behind [PREFIX], its indent dropped. Engine state only: no key
 * material is ever in the engine, so none can reach the log this way.
