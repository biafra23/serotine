/**
 * [AddressKinds] over a verified light client: an address's code, proven by
 * [VerifiedChain.proveCode], read as no code (an EOA), an EIP-7702 delegation designator (an
 * EOA that has delegated), a Safe, or anything else (a contract). Polled, cached and refused
 * as [ProvenReads] describes.
 *
 * A Safe (docs/wallet-ux.md, *Safes*) is code whose hash is a pinned SafeProxy's ([safes]),
 * whose slot 0 names a pinned singleton, and whose storage holds a set-up Safe: its owners, the
 * linked list of the mapping at slot 2 walked from the sentinel `0x1`, as many as slot 3
 * counts, a threshold (slot 4) of at most that many, its nonce (slot 5), its modules (the list
 * at slot 1, whose sentinel every set-up Safe has written), its guard and, from 1.5.0, its
 * module guard. The lists are what the Safe's own getters return; an entry written outside
 * them (a setup delegatecall can) is not something reading them can rule out.
 *
 * Every numbered slot is a storage proof, and all of them must be of one state, no older than
 * the code's: one verified anchor ([ProofAnchor], the attested slot a proof matched; a block
 * label alone can be a peer's report) and one block, the one the reading is labelled with. That
 * rule has no exception, however often a read is made. Every proof that comes back null or throws
 * (a slow or lost peer), the code's first one included, is asked for again, up to [PROOF_TRIES]
 * times in all; a read the head moved under, or one a proof failed in after those tries, is made
 * again, for as long as [SAFE_READ_BUDGET] lasts from the first code proof ([timeSource] measures
 * it, checked between the engine's calls,
 * which each block and are not cut off; a cancelled read stops at its next call), a moment's
 * pause ([RETRY_PAUSE]) after a failed proof. When the
 * slots were of one state and only the code's anchor did not order before it (a walk against a
 * match, or none), the code is proven again too, so the next read can be of one state. The guards
 * are kept at hashed slots no storage proof names, so they are verified reads at the head, which
 * may be a head later than that label. Anything that does not match is a contract, never a Safe. A
 * Safe's reading stands for [SAFE_KEPT_FOR_HEADS] heads (a Safe takes a dozen proofs, and its
 * owners rarely change); any other kind's for one.
 *
 * A dozen proofs one after the other take long enough that the head often moves under them; the
 * root fix is the engine's, several slots in one proof at one block (biafra23/myotis#662), and
 * once it lands a Safe is read in one request. Until then, [debugLog] (debug builds only) says
 * which proof failed or straddled and how many reads a Safe took: public data, and no key is
 * anywhere near this path.
