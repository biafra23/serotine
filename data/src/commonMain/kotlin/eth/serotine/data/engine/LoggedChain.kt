/**
 * [inner] with each request it is asked written to [log] under [SOURCE], named after the
 * `io.myotis.api` call it makes: at [LogLevel.INFO] the name, whether it was answered (ok) or
 * not (failed, with the engine's reason when it gives one) and how long it took; at
 * [LogLevel.DEBUG] also what was asked and what came back, each cut at [MAX_DETAIL] characters.
 * Failed means no answer: none at all, the engine's refusal or rejection, or an exception, which
 * is recorded and thrown on. A verified revert is an answer, and so is a status read of an
 * engine still starting. Nothing is built for a request the log would not keep.
 *
 * What it records is public chain data and this node's own requests: addresses, calls, signed
 * transactions (public once broadcast) and the engine's answers. No key ever reaches a chain.
