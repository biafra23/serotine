/**
 * [CowChain] over the engine's verified reads, on [network], the one network its engine follows,
 * as `VerifiedUniswapV3` is for Uniswap: [pinned] (`CowDeployments` by default) is a venue once
 * the code of its settlement contract and of its vault relayer, proven against the light client's
 * state ([VerifiedChain.proveCode], both in parallel), hashes to its pin. A check that passed, or
 * proved code other than a pin's, is remembered for as long as this adapter lives; one that could
 * not be proven is run again by the next caller. Any other network has no venue here.
 *
 * A call is a verified call at the head ([VerifiedChain.call]), asked only while the light client
 * can verify reads at its head, on [dispatcher]. A device without an engine ([chain] null) answers
 * [ReadUnavailable.NO_ENGINE]. No off-chain service is behind it.
