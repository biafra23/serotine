 * Verified readings of one fact per key — an address, or a holder and a token: what [prove]

 * polls the engine's state every [pollInterval]; while the client can serve verified reads
 * the fact is proven again whenever the verified head has moved — unless [unchangedSince] knows
 * that nothing since its proof touched it — and labelled with the block its proof anchors to. Whenever reads cannot be verified (syncing, asleep, a stale head, no
 * peer serving proofs) the reading says so: [EngineReading.Syncing], or, once the fact was
 * proven, [EngineReading.LastKnown] with that last proof, dated by the verified head it was made
 * at — in this process, or [kept] from an earlier one — an older answer labelled as one, never
 * passed off as current (owner's request, 2026-10-19). Every other failure (a refusal, a stale
 * anchor, an unproven read) says so without it.
 *
 * The last proof per key is shared by all subscribers, so one that re-subscribes on the same
 * head gets it at once instead of fetching it again, and one that arrives while it is being
 * fetched waits for that fetch — or, when the subscriber making it is cancelled midway (a
 * one-shot check that gave up, a screen left), makes it again itself, since a read cut off says
 * nothing of the fact; the [MAX_CACHED] most recently proven keys are kept, so keys
 * only looked at (the Watch screen) do not pile up. A device without
 * an engine ([chain] null) and an engine that is down answer [ReadUnavailable.NO_ENGINE]
 * once and stop, and so does a key the engine refuses ([ReadUnavailable.REFUSED]).
 * Whatever [prove] throws, and a null from it, become [ReadUnavailable.UNPROVEN], and so does
 * an engine state that cannot be read, for that poll — never an answer kept from before; the
 * poll goes on. A cancellation of the poll itself ends it, while a `CancellationException`
 * the engine's own code throws is a failure like any other. No answer from anywhere else
