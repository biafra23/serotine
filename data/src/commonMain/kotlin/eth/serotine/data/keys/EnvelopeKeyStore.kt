/**
 * [KeyStore] and [Signer] in the key adapter: each imported seed sealed in its own envelope ([Envelope]),
 * one file per account (`<address>.seed`) under [directory]. [hardware] is this device's
 * hardware secret, or null on a computer without one; [withoutHardware] is then what the key
 * store reports, [KeyProtection.PASSWORD_ONLY] or, on a computer whose TPM is not used yet,
 * [KeyProtection.PASSWORD_ONLY_TPM_NOT_USED]. Argon2id runs at the lighter cost only
 * when that secret really lives in secure hardware and every guess needs it; otherwise (a
 * software key store, a stored secret the hardware unwraps, none) the envelope must hold up
 * against an offline attack on the password alone (rules 2 and 9), at [passwordOnlyTier], the
 * device's memory tier, or a lighter one when Argon2id cannot have that memory at the moment
 * (the owner's ruling of 2026-10-18). Argon2id short of memory, sealing at the lightest tier or
 * opening an envelope, is said as such ([KeyImport.NotEnoughMemory], [Signing.NotEnoughMemory],
 * [BiometricChange.NotEnoughMemory]), never as a key store that does not work.
 *
 * The seed, the keys and the password's bytes exist only inside a call, as byte arrays this
 * code zeroes before it returns. Files are written durably and readable by this user alone
 * ([EnvelopeCrypto.writeDurably]); keeping [directory] out of backups and device transfers
 * (rule 8) is the host's part: Android's backup rules, the desktop's backup exclusion. A
 * file that cannot be read, or that this device must not open, is reported and passed over,
 * never trusted. It makes Create account's new mnemonics ([newMnemonic]) and signs with a
 * stored account's key ([sign]), the one place that key exists.
 *
 * [biometricKey] is the biometric path's second hardware key where the platform has one
 * (rules 3 and 4): while it is on, each envelope's DEK is also wrapped by it
 * (`<address>.bio`, [BiometricWraps]), and [sign] can open an envelope with a strong
 * biometric instead of the password. Turning it off deletes the key and the wraps. Work runs
 * on [dispatcher]; calls are serialized within the process. [stretch] is libsodium's Argon2id
 * but in tests.
