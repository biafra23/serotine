/**
 * [SentTransfers] kept in the file at [path] (a [VersionedJsonFile]): the signed transactions,
 * each with its signed bytes as hex, which are public once broadcast, and what it does — a
 * transfer's recipient, token and amount, the Safe transaction an approval or execution was
 * for, in the form a signing request travels in, the Safe a deployment created (its address,
 * owners, threshold, version and the name it is listed under), a token approval's token, spender
 * and amount, a swap's router, the asset and amount it sells and the asset and minimum it buys,
 * or a CoW order's cancellation on chain (its settlement contract and UID), and whether it is only
 * maybe sent.
 * An entry that does not decode (a damaged one, or one of a kind this build does not know) is
 * passed over, as [eth.serotine.data.safe.FileSafeTxQueue] passes one over, and the rest are read;
 * the file it was in is then set aside once, whole, and what was read written in its place, so
 * that the entry is kept there rather than lost at the next write;
 * a file that is not one at all is set aside and the record starts empty; one that cannot be read
 * is [SentTransferList.Unreadable] (a quote then goes by the engine's nonce alone).
 *
 * Format 2 adds the Safe transactions, format 3 the Safe deployments, format 4 the transactions
 * maybe sent, format 5 the token approvals and the swaps, format 6 the CoW orders' cancellations
 * on chain; a file of an earlier format reads as it is and is written as 6 at its next change,
 * which a build that reads only an earlier one then leaves alone.
