/**
 * The embedded Myotis engine of this process (docs/embedding-myotis.md; docs/networks.md, *The
 * engine host*): one engine, which hosts one light client per network, each a [ChainNode] that
 * runs only while [set] asks it to (`FollowNetworks`: the network is on, and an account or a
 * screen needs it). A host's composition root creates it with [start] and hands its ports to the
 * AppGraph: [nativeBalances], [tokenBalances], [tokenMetadata], [priceFeeds], [addressKinds],
 * [lightClient], [networkUpgrades], and for sending [transactionInputs], [broadcaster],
 * [receipts] and [names], for a Safe's transactions [safeApprovals], for swaps [uniswap], for the
 * accounts' histories [logIndex], for a home-screen widget's daily change [priceHistory]; each
 * port routes a call to the light client of the network it names ([NetworkRoutedPorts]). The host
 * owns it for the life of the process: [pause] and [resume] every running light client around
 * the app being in the background, [shutdown] on exit. Only `io.myotis.api` and the library's
 * default ports are used; nothing below them.
 *
 * Every start, stop, pause and resume runs on one control thread, in the order asked: the last
 * one asked for a network is what it ends in. The engine itself is created by the first start,
 * and without its library (or with one that fails) every network reads as without a light
 * client ([EngineSnapshot.Down], final). A network whose start fails reads the same way
 * ([EngineSnapshot.Failed]), and is tried again the next time it is asked to run.
