/**
 * The envelope's hardware factor on a Mac with a Secure Enclave, built as docs/keys-and-signing.md
 * builds it for iOS (*The envelope*): `HW_pw` is a P-256 key made inside the enclave, with no
 * user-authentication requirement, and `S_hw` is 32 random bytes encrypted to it with ECIES.
 * Both are kept in [stateFile]: the key as the enclave's own encrypted handle, which only this
 * Mac's enclave can use, and `S_hw` only in its encrypted form. [mix] has the enclave decrypt
 * `S_hw`, so a copied envelope, with or without [stateFile], is useless off this Mac.
 *
 * [stateFile] is made once, on the first [mix] of a wallet that has no envelope on the enclave
 * yet, and never replaced. When it is gone while such envelopes exist, the secret they were
 * sealed with is gone with it: [mix] and [protection] fail, and the key store reports itself
 * unavailable instead of sealing under a new secret.
 *
 * The enclave has no HMAC, so `S_hw` is the same for every guess
 * ([everyGuessNeedsDevice] is false): code that compromises the app can unwrap it once, and
 * Argon2id carries the load (rule 2). The handle carries no caller identity, so it is bound
 * to this Mac but not to the app: any program running as the same user can read [stateFile]
 * and use the enclave with it, without a permission prompt. Binding it to the app would take
 * a different design, the key in the app's own keychain access group, which needs a signed
 * app (the owner's ruling of 2026-10-16 accepts the unsigned binding for now).
