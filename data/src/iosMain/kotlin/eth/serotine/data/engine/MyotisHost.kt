/**
 * The embedded Myotis engine of this process on iOS (docs/embedding-myotis.md; docs/networks.md,
 * *The engine host*): one engine, which hosts one light client per network, each a [ChainNode]
 * that runs only while [set] asks it to (`FollowNetworks`: the network is on, and an account or a
 * screen needs it). The twin of the JVM targets' `MyotisHost` (jvmSharedMain), over Myotis's iOS
 * module (`io.myotis.engine.ios`, which carries `io.myotis.api`'s names and meanings over the
 * engine's C ABI): the same adapters, wired to the same [EngineChain] seam per network, routed
 * by [NetworkRoutedPorts], and the same lifecycle. The iOS host's composition root creates it
 * with [start], hands its ports to the AppGraph and owns it for the life of the process: [pause]
 * and [resume] every running light client around the app being in the background, [shutdown] on
 * exit, as far as iOS lets an app's exit run code at all. Nothing below the iOS module's typed
 * API is used.
 *
 * Every start, stop, pause and resume runs on one control dispatcher, in the order asked: the
 * last one asked for a network is what it ends in. The engine itself is created by the first
 * start; one that cannot be created leaves every network without a light client
 * ([EngineSnapshot.Down], final). A network whose start fails reads as [EngineSnapshot.Failed],
 * and is tried again the next time it is asked to run. No light client here dates a finalized
 * block: Myotis's iOS module reads no block by number yet, so no CoW order is offered on iOS.
