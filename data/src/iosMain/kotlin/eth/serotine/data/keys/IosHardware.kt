/**
 * The hardware secret for the iOS key store whose envelopes live in [keysDirectory]
 * (docs/keys-and-signing.md, *The envelope*): this device's Secure Enclave
 * ([IosSecureEnclaveSecret]). Every iPhone this app runs on has one, so a device build never
 * stands on the password alone, nor asks whether the enclave works: it is the factor, and an
 * enclave that fails makes sealing fail and the key store unavailable. Not asking also keeps a
 * locked device, whose enclave refuses the key until it is unlocked, from deciding anything.
 *
 * The simulator has no enclave, and only a simulator build ([onIosSimulator], fixed at compile
 * time) lets a wallet stand on the password alone, so the app can be developed and tried there;
 * its envelopes say so in their hardware tag, as the desktop's do. Its factor sticks to the
 * wallet as on the desktop: once the enclave holds a wallet's secret it is used again, and only
 * a wallet without envelopes asks whether the enclave works.
