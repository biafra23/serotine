 * The port for where each account's history starts (issue #85): the block from which its
 * network's [LogIndex] follows the account. A start is an account's, by its [AccountId]: the
 * same address on two networks has two starts, each a block of its own chain. An account is noted when it is added, with the time
 * ([HistoryStart.Noted]); `FollowAccountLogs` fixes the block once the light client has a head
 * to measure it from ([HistoryStart.Fixed]), and forgets the start once the account is gone and
 * the index stopped following it. The history is checked from the fixed block on and not before
 * it: for an account not created here, that is the block it was added at (owner ruling,
 * 2026-10-20). Public data only. :data keeps it in a file. Never throws.
