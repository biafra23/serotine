/**
 * Adds an address on a network to the wallet to watch it there (issues #9 and #10). Only what the light client
 * proves is an externally owned account — with or without an EIP-7702 delegation — or a Safe
 * is added, as an [AccountKind.EOA] or [AccountKind.SAFE] held as [AccountCustody.Watched];
 * another contract is refused, and so is an address whose kind cannot be verified right now:
 * the account's kind is chain data, shown verified or not at all. An address already in the
 * wallet on that network, watched or with its key, is refused and named. [label] is trimmed; empty, the
 * account's name follows [ensName], the ENS name the address was resolved from (issue #67), or,
 * with none or one longer than [RenameAccount.MAX_LABEL_LENGTH], is "Account N" as an import
 * names it. The caller resolves [ensName] to [address] just before; whether it still points
 * there is checked again while it is shown ([ObserveEnsNames]).
