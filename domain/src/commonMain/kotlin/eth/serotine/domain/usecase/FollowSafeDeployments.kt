/**
 * Lists every Safe this wallet deployed (docs/wallet-ux.md, screen 15), whatever screen is open:
 * for each recorded deployment ([SentAction.SafeDeployment]) whose listing has not ended, it waits
 * for the verified receipt, then lists the Safe ([ListDeployedSafe]: once the light client proves
 * it after a deployment that succeeded; [ListDeployedSafe.afterRevert], which reads the address
 * once, after one that reverted), and records how that ended in the deployment's own record
 * ([SentAction.SafeDeployment.listed]), which the status screen shows. A Safe in the account list
 * already ends it as listed at once.
 *
 * Run for as long as the app is open (`App` starts it): it picks up after a restart, as the record
 * is kept until the listing ends ([SentTransfers.prune]). An outcome that is no ending — the Safe
 * not verifiable again, the list not saved, a use case that broke its promise — is tried again
 * after [retryDelay]. A deployment is followed for [DEPLOYMENT_LIFETIME_SECONDS] after a peer took
 * it, and no longer (one never mined has no receipt to wait for); [clock] is in unix seconds. One
 * whose listing ended is never listed again: a Safe the user removes since stays removed.
