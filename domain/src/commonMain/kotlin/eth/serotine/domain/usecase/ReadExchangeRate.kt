/**
 * One verified reading of what one [PriceId] costs in a [DisplayCurrency], and what it cost 24
 * hours before (docs/wallet-ux.md, *Home-screen widget*). The rate now is the base's and the
 * quote's USD prices ([ObserveUsdPrice], every price going through USD), each waited for until
 * it is priced or has a lasting answer: no price, no engine, a refusal, a stale anchor. A read
 * that was not proven this time is waited past, for as long as the caller lets it. It is dated
 * by the later of the two heads its legs were read at. The rate a day before is each feed on
 * the same paths read from its own round history ([PriceHistory]), the two legs at once, each
 * read tried again a few times while unproven or syncing, and converted the same way; none
 * when any feed has no verified, fresh round of then: a change is only shown against a rate
 * the light client proved.
