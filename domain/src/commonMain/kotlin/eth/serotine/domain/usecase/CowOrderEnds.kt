/**
 * Proves the end of each CoW order this wallet signed that is still live (docs/swaps.md, *Proving
 * an order's end*), from the account's own entry in the engine's log index, never from CoW's API,
 * and records it ([CowOrders.end]). Run by the hosts while the engine runs, as `FollowAccountLogs`
 * is, so that an order's end is proven whatever screen is open, and again after a restart.
 *
 * The proof reads no past state: a verified `getLogs` of the account's `Mention` entry, at topic 1
 * (the owner), for `Trade` and `OrderInvalidated`, from the block finalized when the order was
 * signed to the newest finalized block. Only logs the order's own settlement contract emitted
 * count, and only those carrying its UID ([GPv2Settlement]). The index answers only a range it
 * covers in full, and the adapter refuses one reaching below the entry's start
 * ([LogsReading.BeforeStart]), so an empty answer is a proven absence.
 *
 * - A `Trade` for the order: filled ([CowOrderEnd.Filled]).
 * - Else its `OrderInvalidated`, in a block at or below the finalized one: never filled, cancelled
 *   ([CowOrderEnd.Unfilled]); nothing settles an order after it, and a settlement earlier in the
 *   same block would be a `Trade` in the range.
 * - Else, once the finalized block's own timestamp is past the order's `validTo`: never filled.
 * - A settlement log of either event that does not decode proves nothing, and is tried again:
 *   skipped, it could hide this order's fill.
 * - Two cases can never be proven ([CowOrderEnd.NotProvable]), and are said so only once a finalized
 *   block is past `validTo`: until then the order may still fill, and its tokens stay held back.
 *   - A range below the entry's start.
 *   - An entry no longer followed because its account is no longer in the wallet ([accounts]). Its
 *     entry and logs were dropped with it, and an account added again starts its history after the
 *     order.
 * - A range not covered yet, no answer right now, or an entry not followed yet for an account the
 *   wallet holds (as at every start, until the index is configured) is tried again. So is every
 *   entry not followed while the account list cannot be read.
