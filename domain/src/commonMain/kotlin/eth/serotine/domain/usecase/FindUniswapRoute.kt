 *
 * 1. the network's pinned deployment, once its code is proven ([UniswapV3Chain.venue]);
 * 2. each pool [SwapRoutes.poolsToRead] names, as the factory's `getPool` and, for one it lists,
 *    its `liquidity()`;
 * 3. each candidate [SwapRoutes.candidates] makes of them, quoted by QuoterV2 for the amount;
 * 4. the quote that returns the most ([SwapRoutes.best]), ranked as [RouteRanking] says.
 *
 * Ranked net of fees, a route's fee is its QuoterV2 gas × (the next base fee + the Normal tip),
 * converted into the bought token by one more quote: that much WETH sold for it in its deepest
 * pool, for the route with the most gas, the others' fees taking their share of it by their gas.
 * The fee per gas is the same for every route, so their fees are in proportion to their gas. When
 * the bought token is WETH (or ETH), nothing is converted. A fee that cannot be had, or converted,
 * leaves the routes ranked gross, and the finding says so ([RouteFinding.Found.netOfFees]): the
 * ranking only picks among verified quotes, and the signed minimum comes from the chosen route's
 * own quote either way.
 *
 * Every read is made at once, each pool and each quote in parallel. One that could not be had
 * leaves no route (unavailable, with its reason): a route found from part of the pools could be
 * a worse one, unsaid. A quote that reverts drops its route (its pool cannot take the amount).
