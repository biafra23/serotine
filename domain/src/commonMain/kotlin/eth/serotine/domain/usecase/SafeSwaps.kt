 * ([RouteRanking.GROSS]: whoever executes it pays the fee), the minimum its verified QuoterV2
 * quote less the tolerance, and the deadline the verified head's time plus
 * [SAFE_SWAP_DEADLINE_SECONDS]: both fixed in the `SafeTx` its owners sign. Nothing is proposed on
 * less than verified state, and prices never reach it.
 *
 * - **The approval.** A token sold needs the router's allowance for the whole amount, as the
 *   chain has it (a verified call from no sender, [UniswapV3Chain.call]) and as the approvals of
 *   the router queued before the swap leave it (per nonce the least of its alternatives, since
 *   any one of them may be the one that runs). One that falls short is approved for the exact
 *   amount (owner ruling, 2026-10-19, #69's decision 3) in its own Safe transaction at the Safe's
 *   next nonce, and the swap takes the nonce after it: two Safe transactions, since a MultiSend
 *   batch is a delegate call, refused until it is built.
 * - **The nonce.** The Safe's next one, as [ProposeSafeTx] takes it. Or, to propose a swap again
 *   with a fresh minimum ([replacing]), the nonce of one queued there that is the same swap (the
 *   pair, the amount and the router): only one transaction at a nonce ever runs, and one that
 *   moves what the one it replaces moves leaves those queued after it as they were. Such a swap
 *   gets no approval of its own.
 * - **What is held back.** What the transactions queued before it may move of the asset sold is
 *   not this one's to sell. A swap of the token through the router queued before it counts on the
 *   allowance this one would set, so one is proposed only once that one has run or gone.
 * - **The runs.** Each is run as a verified call from the Safe's address at the head: the
 *   approval, which must not revert nor return false; the swap, which must return at least its
 *   minimum, but only while the allowance on chain already covers it: one waiting for an approval
 *   cannot run yet ([SafeSwapSimulation.AfterApproval]). An engine that will not run a call from a
 *   contract's address leaves them not run. A token that refuses one allowance for another
 *   (USDT's kind: its approval reverts while one is set) is not proposed here: setting it to zero
 *   first would take a third Safe transaction.
 *
 * What refuses it from the queue and the light client alone is said before the engine is asked
 * for a balance or a route. Nothing is saved: signing each ([SignSafeTx]) queues it. On [network]
 * only.
