/**

 * first report it, again a week and a day before its activation, and once when it has
 * activated, after which nothing more is said about it. The record in [known] carries what
 * has been shown across restarts, so each notice is shown once (twice at worst, when its record
 * could not be written: told twice beats never), and what is still to come falls due while the
 * app is not running: the notifier is asked to wake it then.
 *
 * Fed by [FollowUpgradeReports] while the engine runs, and by the host's alarm through
 * [remind] while it does not. One instance per process: its calls take turns.
