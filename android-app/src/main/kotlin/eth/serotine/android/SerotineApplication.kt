/**
 * The Android composition root: the one place that knows which adapters implement the
 * domain's ports on this platform, and the owner of the process's one Myotis engine
 * (docs/embedding-myotis.md). Built once per process; activities read [graph]. The engine's
 * networking is on while something holds it ([holdEngine]: a visible activity, the daily
 * upgrade check), and while it is, the engine's upgrade reports are followed into
 * notifications ([upgradeNotices]), the Safes this wallet deployed are listed once the light
 * client proves them ([FollowSafeDeployments]), the engine's log index follows the accounts
 * ([FollowAccountLogs]) and, while an activity is visible and an exchange-rate widget is
 * placed, its rate is kept current ([FollowExchangeRate]): the work no screen owns, run here
 * beside the [graph], on the same adapters, and never from the shared UI. The widget's refresh
 * while the app is closed ([RateRefreshJob]) wakes the engine alone, without that work
 * ([refreshRateInBackground]).
