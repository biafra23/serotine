# CLAUDE.md

Instructions for an AI coding agent working in this repository; humans read
them too. Serotine is the sibling of
[biafra23/myotis](https://github.com/biafra23/myotis): a Compose Multiplatform
wallet for Ethereum accounts (EOAs) and Safe{Wallet} smart accounts, built on
the embedded Myotis engine. **The rules of development are Myotis's.** On
2026-10-26 their text was split into the files below and reworded in shorter
sentences; the rules, the owner rulings and their dates are unchanged. Myotis
still carries the original wording in its one CLAUDE.md.

Words used throughout: **the owner** is the repository owner (biafra23). An
**owner ruling** is a decision only the owner can change; it is quoted with
its date and, where there is one, its issue or PR number, like "(owner
ruling, 2026-10-18, #55)". **A finding** is something a reviewer must flag.
**A port** is an interface in `:domain`; **an adapter** implements it in
`:data`; **a use case** is one user-visible capability; **a host** is an app
module with the one **composition root** that wires adapters to ports.
**Verified** means proven by the embedded Myotis light client.

## How these instructions are organized

This file is always loaded. It holds the short form of every rule and says
where the full text is, so a session loads only what it needs. A rule file
(`.claude/rules/`) loads by itself when a file matching its `paths:` is read
or edited. A skill (`.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) loads on demand:
`/<name>`, or when the task matches its description.

| Rule file | Loads for | Full text of |
|---|---|---|
| `architecture.md` | `domain/`, `data/`, `ui/`, the hosts, the root build files | Architecture; SOLID, tests per layer, the feature checklist |
| `platform.md` | every `.kt` and `.kts` file, `gradle/` | Kotlin conventions; Platform & language direction; the minSdk 29 JDK-API budget |
| `ui.md` | `ui/`, the screen docs | the greyed-out rule, previews, how a screen is laid out |
| `hosts.md` | `android-app/`, `desktop-app/`, `ios-app/` | composition roots, the two Android apps, signing |
| `trust.md` | the code modules, the root build files, `docs/` | Trust: verification, the Safe refusals, key material, how keys are held |
| `data-sources.md` | the code modules, the root build files, `docs/` | Data sources: networks, prices, tokens, Safe co-signing, history, swaps, CoW |
| `github-workflows.md` | `.github/`, `scripts/` | the invariants of the workflows; how fork PRs are reviewed |
| `instructions.md` | this file, `.claude/`, `docs/` | how to change these instructions |

| Skill | Use it when | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `pr` | you reach step 3 of the Workflow, or handle a review comment or CI on a PR | developer |
| `screenshots` | a PR changes what the user sees | developer, UX designer |
| `feature-branch` | a work item needs more than one PR | developer |
| `release` | the owner asks for a release, a version bump or a `v*` tag | developer |
| `reviewer` | you review a diff or a PR | reviewer |
| `ux` | you design or change a screen, a flow or the words the user sees | UX designer |

**Roles.** A developer starts with this file; the rules load as code is
touched; `/pr` comes at step 3 of the Workflow. A reviewer starts with
`/reviewer`. A UX designer starts with `/ux`. **Before you change code, make
sure `architecture.md` and `trust.md` have loaded**; a rule loads on a Read,
Write or Edit of a matching file, not on a grep. If your tool does not load
rules or skills by itself, read the files named above for your task before
you start. **Other agents:** Qwen Code reads `QWEN.md`, which imports this file,
and finds the same rules and skills through `.qwen/rules` and `.qwen/skills`
(symlinks). Any other agent: read this file, then the files it names.

## Build & Run

```bash
# Build all modules: compile, unit tests (JVM + Android unit), the headless Compose UI tests,
# Android lint, the debug + release APKs. Needs JDK 21 and an Android SDK (ANDROID_HOME, or
# sdk.dir in a git-ignored local.properties). The iOS targets build on macOS only.
./gradlew build
./gradlew :ui:desktopTest                                                   # one module's tests
./gradlew :domain:desktopTest --tests "eth.serotine.domain.model.AddressTest" # one class
./gradlew :desktop-app:run                                                  # the desktop app
./gradlew :android-app:installDebug                                         # the debug app on a device
# The iOS app (macOS, Xcode, `brew install xcodegen`): the Xcode project is generated, not committed
cd ios-app/xcode && SEROTINE_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=<team id> xcodegen generate && open Serotine.xcodeproj
./gradlew :ios-app:linkDebugFrameworkIosSimulatorArm64                      # the framework alone
./gradlew :desktop-app:packageDeb   # Linux;  packageDmg on macOS;  packageMsi on Windows (WiX 3)
# Every screen's previews as PNGs in build/screenshots/, for a PR that changes the UI
./gradlew :ui:desktopTest --tests '*PreviewsTest' --rerun -Pscreenshots=build/screenshots
./gradlew -q :printReleaseVersion   # the release version the tag guard compares against
```

## Architecture

Full text: `.claude/rules/architecture.md`. **docs/architecture.md is the
contract.**

- Clean architecture with MVVM. Modules: `domain` (pure Kotlin, no Android
  target), `data` (the adapters, the Myotis engine adapter among them), `ui`
  (Compose Multiplatform; depends on `:domain` only), and the hosts
  `android-app`, `desktop-app`, `ios-app` (one composition root each).
- **The dependency rule: arrows point inward only.** `:domain` depends on
  nothing of ours. `:ui` and `:data` depend on `:domain`. The hosts depend on
  `:ui` and `:data` and alone know which adapter implements which port. A
  violation is a finding.
- **MVVM.** A screen is a pure function of an immutable UiState. A ViewModel
  exposes `StateFlow<UiState>`, calls use cases, never a repository, and
  holds no platform reference. Errors the user must see are UiState variants.
- **The Myotis boundary.** All chain data comes from the embedded engine
  through the `io.myotis.api` contract and nothing else. The adapter lives in
  `:data`. `:domain` and `:ui` never import `io.myotis.*`.
- **Dependency injection** is manual constructor injection from the
  composition roots. No DI framework; adding one is the owner's decision.

## Conventions

Full text: `.claude/rules/platform.md`, `.claude/rules/ui.md`,
`.claude/rules/hosts.md`.

- Kotlin, official style, 120 columns, immutable by default, structured
  concurrency only, KDoc on every public type. Tests per layer, all run by
  `./gradlew build`.
- **A missing prerequisite greys an action out, never hides it** (owner
  ruling, 2026-10-18, #55). A tap on the greyed item says what is missing and
  how to get it.
- **Every screen has previews** (owner's request, 2026-10-17): one per state
  plus one in the dark theme, rendered by a test, so a broken preview fails
  the build.
- Adding a feature follows the five-step checklist at the end of
  docs/architecture.md, and the PR describes it along those steps.
- Two Android apps come out of `:android-app`, release and debug. **Never
  give the release build type a `signingConfig`.**

## Workflow — the mandatory steps for EVERY work item

Full text of steps 3 to 5: `.claude/skills/pr/SKILL.md`. Do every step, in
order. None is optional, and none waits to be asked for. The only time to
skip the PR is when the user explicitly says not to open one.

1. **Code** the change on the designated branch.
2. **Review** your own diff: `/code-review` in Claude Code; in another tool,
   `/reviewer` on your own diff. Fix what it finds.
3. **PR.** Open the pull request: base `main`, or the feature branch for a
   part of a multi-PR plan. The description follows the PR rules below.
4. **Wait for review comments, and make sure they reach you.** In the
   desktop app, right after `gh pr create` returns: `mcp__ccd_pr__set_monitor`
   with the PR's URL, `auto_fix: true`, `address_comments: true`; it is per
   PR and off by default (owner ruling, 2026-10-09). Elsewhere
   `subscribe_pr_activity`. "Pushed" is not "done".
5. **Address every comment** and drive CI to green. Keep watching until the
   PR is merged or closed.

**MERGING IS THE OWNER'S ACTION. NEVER MERGE A PR YOURSELF** (owner ruling,
2026-08-31). Green CI plus every comment answered means: report "ready to
merge" and keep watching. The one exception is a part PR into a feature
branch when the owner said yes for that plan (the `feature-branch` skill).
In the Claude Code desktop app the session renames itself (owner's request,
2026-10-09): `IS#<n>: <title>` once the issue is known, `PR#<n>: <title>`
once the PR exists (the `pr` skill).

## Multi-PR plans land through a feature branch, never piece by piece on `main`

Full text: `.claude/skills/feature-branch/SKILL.md`.

- **`main` must be releasable at every commit** (owner ruling, 2026-09-30).
- A work item of more than one PR gets `feature/<topic>` first, from `main`.
  Every part PR targets the feature branch. The final PR is
  `feature/<topic>` → `main`.
- Ask the owner, once per plan and before the first part is coded, whether
  you may merge the part PRs into the feature branch yourself. Without a
  "yes" in this conversation, the owner merges them.
- A PR into `main` is never yours to merge.

## Releases — ask before cutting one

Full text: `.claude/skills/release/SKILL.md`.

- Everything a release needs goes into ONE release PR.
- **The tag is the owner's action.** Never push a `v*` tag on your own
  initiative (owner rulings, 2026-09-02 and 2026-09-11 in Myotis).
- Moving the version pin is mandatory, not a question (owner ruling,
  2026-09-24): `version = "X.Y.Z-SNAPSHOT"` in the root `build.gradle.kts`.

## Pull requests and code review

Full text: `.claude/skills/pr/SKILL.md`; the reviewer's side,
`.claude/skills/reviewer/SKILL.md`.

- **Everything on GitHub is in English** (owner ruling, 2026-09-17): title,
  description, commits, replies.
- A PR description ends with the session link, never with the "Generated
  with Claude Code" footer (owner ruling, 2026-10-09).
- A PR that changes the UI shows it in screenshots, or says "No UI change"
  (owner's request, 2026-10-19). The `screenshots` skill.
- Reply to every review comment, one by one, on its own thread, with a plain
  verdict: Accepted, Disputed or Deferred. Verify the claim first.
- Fix review comments on the PR's own branch, never in a separate PR (owner
  ruling, 2026-10-09). Drive CI to green. Never merge.
- **Fork PRs are reviewed manually, never by the CI reviewer** (owner's
  decision, 2026-08-15).

## Platform & language direction

Full text: `.claude/rules/platform.md`.

- **Android first**: minSdk 29. No JVM-only API that desugaring cannot
  cover. No `java.net.http`. HTTP, when needed at all, through Ktor.
- The minSdk 29 JDK-API budget lists what is safe and what is not;
  `scripts/check_apk_min_api.py` enforces it on the built APKs.
- Java 17 class files for everything Android loads.
- Kotlin and Compose Multiplatform everywhere; new code in `commonMain`.
- Toolchain pins mirror Myotis's (`gradle/libs.versions.toml`).

## Trust

Full text: `.claude/rules/trust.md`. These rules bind every change.

- **Peer-trusted is never an option.** Everything shown about the chain is
  verified by the embedded Myotis engine or shown as not available. No
  JSON-RPC provider, indexer or "temporary" fallback, in any build type.
- One older answer is shown, labelled as one (owner's request, 2026-10-19):
  a balance proved earlier stays on screen, dated, out of totals, never acted
  on. Past the weak-subjectivity window only on the user's word (owner's
  request, 2026-10-24).
- A Safe transaction that sets a fallback handler other than the pinned one,
  or none (owner ruling, 2026-10-18, #63), or enables a module (owner ruling,
  2026-10-18, on #54), is shown and never signed, approved or executed.
- Network-upgrade warnings are peer reports and say so (owner's request,
  2026-10-17).
- A parameter that can change the answer is APPLIED or REFUSED, never
  accepted and silently ignored (Myotis #314).
- **Key material** lives in the key-store adapter and nowhere else. The
  exceptions are a closed list of owner rulings; today only the mnemonic
  screens (owner ruling, 2026-10-15): the words travel as the dedicated
  mnemonic type along one path and are cleared when the screen is left.
- How keys are held: docs/keys-and-signing.md is the contract. On the
  password path BOTH the Argon2id-stretched password AND a secret of the
  device's hardware key store must be cryptographically necessary to unwrap a
  key; a password that is merely checked is a finding.

## Data sources

Full text: `.claude/rules/data-sources.md`. docs/wallet-ux.md applies these
rulings to the screens.

- The only source of chain data is the embedded Myotis engine. HTTP to a node
  is for debugging only.
- Networks: Ethereum, Gnosis Chain and Sepolia; one chain per account; no
  current network; each network can be turned off; Sepolia keeps every
  testnet warning and is never added to a total with real funds (owner
  ruling, 2026-10-22).
- Prices come from Chainlink aggregators read through the light client, and
  are display-only: a price never reaches a signature (owner ruling,
  2026-10-16). The token list is built in
  (owner ruling, 2026-10-16). Safe co-signing uses no off-chain service
  (owner ruling, 2026-10-16).
- An account's history comes from the engine's verified log index (owner
  rulings, 2026-10-20, #85).
- Swaps: Uniswap first, then CoW Protocol; the user chooses the venue (owner's
  directions, 2026-10-18 and 2026-10-22). CoW's order API is used only for a
  swap the user sends to CoW (owner ruling, 2026-10-22).
- Open, recorded here before its code lands: the dApp connection protocol.
